# Classification Model

Overview
Welcome to the Classification Model repository! This project focuses on building and evaluating classification models for various datasets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify data into different categories based on input features.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
Model Building: Build classification models using popular machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to improve performance using techniques such as grid search and random search.
